# Made-With-ML

For this project I followed the MLOps course by [Goku Mohandas](https://madewithml.com). I wanted to learn about other [ray](https://www.ray.io) functionalities other than [ray tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html). The deployment of a language model for text classification covers following components of the MLOps lifecycle:


1) Model training with [Ray Train](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/train/train.html)
2) Hyperparameter tuning with [Ray Tune](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)
3) Model serving with [Ray Serve](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html)
4) Deployment with [Anyscale Jobs](https://docs.anyscale.com/jobs/get-started)
5) CI/CD with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
